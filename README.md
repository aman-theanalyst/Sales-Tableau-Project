# Sales-Tableau-Project

## üè¢ Project Background

This project simulates a retail business operating in the consumer goods sector. The company operates across various regions and product categories, with a primary business model focused on direct B2C (business-to-consumer) sales. As a data analyst, the objective is to understand key sales metrics, analyze trends across different dimensions (e.g., regions, categories), and derive insights to support data-driven decision-making.

The project leverages Excel data cleaning, SQL-based data analysis, and Tableau for data visualization to deliver a clear, concise, and actionable sales performance report.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

‚Ä¢ Sales Performance Analysis: Overall sales, profit, and quantity trends.  
‚Ä¢ Customer Behavior Analysis: Customer acquisition, order frequency, and top customer segments.  
‚Ä¢ Product Performance Analysis: Sales and profitability by product sub-category.  
‚Ä¢ Geographic Sales Distribution: Sales and customer insights across different regions.

## üí° Executive Summary

### üîç Overview of Findings

The following three insights are most critical:  

1. West and Central regions generate the highest sales, but also show significant returns. More targeted strategies could optimize performance.  
2. Office Supplies is the fastest-growing category in terms of sales growth across years.  
3. Certain sub-categories, like Binders and Chairs, experience disproportionately high return rates, impacting profit margins.

### üìà Insights Deep Dive

#### üçø Category & Sub-category Trends

‚Ä¢ Best-selling category: Technology  
‚Ä¢ High-volume sub-categories: Phones and Chairs  
‚Ä¢ High-profit sub-categories: Copiers, Accessories and Paper  
‚Ä¢ Sub-Category Always in Loss: Tables  
‚Ä¢ Trend in Customer: No. of customer is maximum in 4th quater of the year  

#### üóìÔ∏è Time-based Trends

‚Ä¢ Peak sales months: September, October, November & December  
‚Ä¢ Consistent sales dip: January, February   
‚Ä¢ Year-over-year growth: Upward trend in Profit

## ‚úÖ Recommendations:

1. Remove Tables from Sub-Category as they are always in loss.
2. Try to plan some strategies (like Discount, Provide some freebies on purchase, etc) for 1st quater of the year as the sales and toatal customer in this part of year are lowest.
3. Shift marketing and logistical resources to South and Central Region as Sales is less there.
4. Investigate return causes and adjust inventory accordingly.
5. Introduce more high-margin tech products in top-performing regions.
